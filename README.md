📄 Project Documentation: Cura
1. Project Overview
Cura is an all-in-one AI-powered pandemic toolkit designed to assist individuals, organizations, and communities during global health crises like COVID-19. The application focuses on providing a user-friendly, intuitive interface accessible to users of all technical proficiency levels.

2. Problem Statement Addressed
Navigating a pandemic involves managing information overload, mental health strain, and resource scarcity. Cura solves these by centralizing verified data, healthcare tools, and community support in a single, multilingual platform.

3. Key Features
Information Hub: Provides real-time, reliable updates on pandemic data (Active Cases, Vaccination Rates) to prevent the spread of misinformation.

Healthcare Resources: Includes an AI-guided Symptom Checker to assess risk and a Resource Finder for hospital beds and oxygen supplies.

Mental Health Support: Promotes well-being through integrated meditation guides and direct access to volunteer therapists.

Community Connection: A dedicated space for neighbors to request or offer assistance, such as grocery runs or medicine deliveries.

Multilingual Accessibility: Designed with a language toggle (English, Hindi, Tamil, etc.) to ensure no one is left behind due to a language barrier.

4. Design Choices (UI/UX)
Visual Hierarchy: Used a "Tab-based" navigation system to keep the interface clean and avoid overwhelming the user.

Color Psychology: Applied Red for high-priority alerts, Green for safe zones, and Blue for informative actions to provide instant visual feedback.

Simplicity: Minimized text and maximized the use of buttons and icons to ensure the app is usable by seniors or non-tech-savvy individuals.
